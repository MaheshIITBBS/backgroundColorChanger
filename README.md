# Background Color Changer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to change the background color of a webpage with a click of a button. It's an excellent way to practice working with JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Features
- **Easy to Use**: Click a button to change the background color.
- **Random Color Generation**: Each click generates a random color.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes.

## How It Works
The background color changer works by attaching an event listener to a button. When the button is clicked, a JavaScript function is triggered that generates a random color and applies it to the background of the webpage.
